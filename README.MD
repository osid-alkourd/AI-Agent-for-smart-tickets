# 🤖 AI-Ticket-Assistant 

The AI Smart Tickets service is an AI agent that automatically assigns tickets created by a user to the most suitable moderator based on the ticket's content.

For example, if a user creates a ticket stating that they are facing an issue running a service built with Node.js, the AI service will assign this ticket to a moderator who has strong expertise in Node.js based on their registered skills. This eliminates the need for manual assignment by the admin. Additionally, the service provides a clear explanation of the user's issue, as the user may not express the problem accurately. The service offers an appropriate clarification so that the moderator can respond effectively.

The previous image represents the ticket details.
For example, the AI Agent updated the ticket status from TODO to IN_PROGRESS.
The priority of the ticket will be set based on its description, as shown in the previous ticket.
The AI Agent will also assign the ticket to the appropriate moderator based on the nature of the issue.

For instance, in the previous example, the user mentioned they were facing a specific issue related to Node.js.
Based on this, the AI Agent assigned the ticket to the moderator whose skills best match the problem description. In that case, the ticket was assigned to the moderator at mahmoud@gmail.com.

Additionally, helpful notes will be added to provide the moderator with a clearer explanation of the issue.
